In our endeavor to address the critical issue of women's safety, our project aims to develop a comprehensive mobile application equipped with essential features tailored to enhance security and provide peace of mind. Through innovative technology and user-centric design, our app seeks to empower women to navigate their surroundings with confidence and assurance.

****SOS Button for Emergency Alerts** :** Central to our mission of safeguarding women is the prominent SOS button integrated into our app interface. This intuitive feature allows users to immediately signal for help during emergencies, transmitting their precise location to designated contacts or authorities for swift response and assistance.

By harnessing user feedback and community insights, this dynamic feature not only helps users navigate safer routes but also fosters a supportive environment where individuals can actively contribute to enhancing security awareness and vigilance within their surroundings.
